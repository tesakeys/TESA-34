# TESA34 Keyboard

This is a repository for the TESA34, a custom 34 key keyboard project. The keyboard features a compact layout with 34 keys, including a set of function keys, number keys, and a navigation cluster. It uses a Seeeduino RP2040 microcontroller for programmability and features an OLED display and rotary encoder for added functionality. The keyboard supports both Cherry MX and Kailh Choc switches.

## Features
