# TESA34 Keyboard
This is a repository for the TESA34, a custom 34 key keyboard project. The keyboard features a compact layout with 34 keys, including a set of function keys, number keys, and a navigation cluster. It uses a Seeeduino RP2040 microcontroller for programmability and features an OLED display and rotary encoder for added functionality. The keyboard supports both Cherry MX and Kailh Choc switches.

## Features

- Compact 34 key layout
- Seeeduino RP2040 microcontroller for programmability

## Getting Started

To build the keyboard, you will need the following components:

- PCB
- Case
- Switches
- Keycaps
- Seeeduino RP2040 microcontroller
- Rotary encoder
- OLED display

Once you have the components, you can use the provided firmware and keymap to customize the keyboard to your liking. You can also modify the firmware and keymap to add new features or change the layout.
